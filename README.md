users move from surface-level understanding to deeper, interconnected knowledge
across a variety of fields. 
## Visualization
Visualization Format: Using flowchart or dividing the section into half for input
and output showing results, including steps like search suggestions, concept
linking, etc.
1. Search Input Box : Top of the screen. A simple text box where the user enters
their topic. The user types in a broad topic or search query.
2. Leading Questions Box : Below or next to the search input. A set of

## Current Implementations Few Examples 
### 1. Coursera
This platform often use leading questions and concept linking to
guide learners toward relevant courses based on their current interests or learning
goals.
Coursera might prompt: "Would you like to build your skills in data science,
which is the top-growing field in tech?"
### 2. Google Search Engine
NLP models enable Google AI(Gemini) to
generate dynamic leading questions and conceptual links.
### 3. ChatGPT
ChatGPT uses advanced NLP to identify key concepts, ask relevant
follow-up questions, and link related ideas to foster a deeper, ongoing
conversation. It is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series.
### 4. Meta AI Llama 3.2
LLaMA can generate text based on a given prompt. This
can be used to create leading questions or link concepts by generating text that
connects ideas or prompts further discussion. Generate visual mind maps that
connect ideas, concepts, and keywords, helping users explore relationships and
hierarchies.
